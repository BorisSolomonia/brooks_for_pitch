# Deployment (Deprecated Wrapper)

This file is retained for backward compatibility.

## Canonical Docs
- `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`
- `BUILD_GUIDE_DETAILED.md`
- `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE_DETAILED.md`

## Authoritative Deployment Document
Use `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE_DETAILED.md` for deployment and operations.

## Why This File Was Simplified
Older content in this file mixed:
- legacy monolith instructions
- outdated VM/zone/IP examples
- stale container names (`brooks-backend`, `brooks-db`)

To avoid operational mistakes, those details were consolidated into the canonical guide.
