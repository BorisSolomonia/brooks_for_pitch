# Deployment Summary (Archived)

This file is historical and no longer authoritative.

## Use Instead
- `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE_DETAILED.md`
- `QUICKSTART.md`

## Reason
Previous summary included environment- and time-specific values (VM names, zones, IPs, old container topology) that drifted from current production.
